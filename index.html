      <h2>What is sloth day?</h2>
      <p>
        Sloth day is a holiday for us. Not for your mother, father, loved one, some diety, a
        tradition, culture, historical event, or anyone else! It's a holiday for you, and for me, and
        for everyone, to celebrate themselves, completely disconnect from the world, and do absolutely
        nothing productive and just allow yourself to be.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>When is sloth day?</h2>
      <p>
        Sloth falls on the third Sunday of April every year. To find out when it falls this current
        year, simply scroll up to the countdown on this page.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>How do you celebrate sloth day?</h2>
      <p>
        It's easy! You simply chill, disconnect, and don't do work! But you must be careful. Do not
        engage in any activity that would ask of someone else to relinquish their sloth day. That
        means that ordering food or take out, going to restaurants, shops, or any other activity
        where you would interact with someone who works! Sloth day is an equal opportunity holiday,
        and so your activities should not depend on someone being forced to work during this wondorous
        holiday, lest you steal their chance to celebrate as well.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>But how am I gonna sloth without food or entertainment?!</h2>
      <p>
        Ah, not to worry my friend, why that's the point of Sloth Day's Eve!
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>What's sloth day's eve?</h2>
      <p>
        We understand that we live in a capitalist society, and thus, the chance for an 
        anti-capitalist holiday succeeding would be slim to none. Luckily, Sloth Day is no single
        holiday, but comes paired with the wonderful Sloth Day's Eve! On the day before sloth day,
        you venture out into the world in order to stock up on everything that you may need
        to celebrate a successful sloth day without ever bothering someone the day of! Order
        all the food, rent, buy, or download those movies, books, or games (streaming service
        are not allowed during sloth day!), get those comfy pajamas, and maybe even a sloth hat to
        get into the spirit! Flex that capitalism muscle and acquire everything and anything you
        may need to celebrate a truly disconnected sloth day!
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Who created sloth day?</h2>
      <p>
        Sloth day was created by <a href="https://noj.cc">Manoj</a> and Lillian Kwok one day
        when they got super bored while eating McDonald's 20pc nuggets for the amazing deal of $4
        back in 2014 when they were both unemployed, thus exemplefying the true meaning of sloth.
        They've been celebrating sloth day personally every year since, and have now decided to share
        this holiday with the world!
